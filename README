Stupid, small application for modifying photos by apply pre-defined 
filters.

Photomagick is written in Python, wxWidgets and PIL so it should be
portable and possible to run in every environment supported by this
software.

Application work in two main modes:
- command line - allow to batch processing selected images
- gui - allow to apply some filters and see result

In GUI-mode, there are three available options:
- simple - allow to use predefined, "main" filters
- advanced - allow to choice three filters: style, modifier and decorator
- expert - allow to choice any combination of all available filters.

Implemented algorithms and filters are based GIMP code.


Requirements
============

- Python 2.6
- wxPython 2.8.x (python-wxgtk2.8)
- Python Imaging Library (PIL) 1.1.7+  (python-imaging)

Optional:

- Python and PIL headers and C compiler for compiling optional supporting 
  modules.


Usage
======

Basic usage
-----------
- launch photomagick.pwd
- open some files
- select filter or filters
- save processed image or process all loaded images

Basic batch-mode usage
----------------------
- from console launch "photomagick.pyw --list-filters" for list all available
  filters

- from console launch "photomagick.pyw -b -F <filters names separated 
  by comma> <images>"

- run "photomagick.pyw --help" for more information.

Debug mode
----------
- launch from console "photomagick_dbg.py" instead of "photomagick.pyw".


Extending
=========

Photomagick may be extended by user by creating new filters in Python and 
putting it in ~/.local/share/photomagick/filters/. Please look on 
sample/plugin_template.py for almost empty template.


Installing & building
=====================

In basic this program don't need installing - you should run it 
by launching "photomagick.pyw" file

If you want build supporting modules (for faster processing) follow the steps::

    ./setup.py build_ext
    cp build/*/photomagick/support/*.so photomagick/support/

or simple::

    ./setup.py build
    ./setup.py install
